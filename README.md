## Why a separate Repository

Making a separate Repository has multiple reasons:

1. I don't clutter my other repositories with info not related to the repository itself (e.g. the QR-code images) which would bloat the repository needlessly
2. I don't have to maintain the Donation section in each and every mod I make.
3. I don't have to maintain a donation section on other pages (e.g. Moddb Addon Description).

## Donate via other means

You can open an issue in this repository if you want to donate via other means not listed here - I'll consider it.

But please keep in mind that I cannot add every cryptocurrency or donation / tip service that's available.

I did consider sites Like Patreon and buymeacoffee, however I'm not sure these fit my usecase (I do not want to "paywall" (aka "supporter benefits") my stuff, not even pre-releases)

Though of course if someone asks I could create a Patreon / buymeacoffee page, just don't expect to get any "benefits" (if those services even allow me to "not" give any benefits) - well except my gratitude of course.

## Donation

Please note donations are not ways to buy support or other related services. As such I also do not promise future updates or to fulfill any requests.

Of course the sourcecode of my mods / plugins is (kind of) copyleft (see the license of the repository in question) so in case I disappear without a trace forking and continued development by others is still an option. If I do not want to develop something anymore (and I dont go MIA) I would also have no problem to hand over the repositories in question to the Anomaly community.

With that out of the way, here are ways you can donate, should you still want to do so.
